# Credit Card Fraud Detection

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates a machine learning approach to detecting fraudulent credit card transactions. The notebook leverages Python and various data science libraries to build and evaluate a model for fraud detection.

## Introduction

In the banking industry, credit card theft is a major problem. Reducing losses requires building precise algorithms to identify fraudulent transactions. In this research, a dataset of credit card transactions is used to investigate the application of machine learning algorithms to detect fraudulent transactions.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is highly imbalanced, containing many more legitimate transactions than fraudulent ones. It includes features derived from Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to protect sensitive information.

## Dependencies

To run the notebook, you will need the following Python libraries:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

The notebook is structured as follows:

**Introduction and Dataset Loading**: This section covers the problem's introduction as well as the dataset's loading.
2. **Data Exploration and Preprocessing**: This section covers dataset exploration as well as preprocessing procedures including scaling and addressing missing values.
3. **Model Training**: Using the processed dataset, train different machine learning models.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Assessing the models with measures like F1-score, recall, accuracy, and precision.
5. **Conclusion**: Synopsis of research and possible directions for future study.


## Results

The results section of the notebook provides insights into the performance of different models. Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are used to evaluate the models. The notebook includes visualizations to help understand the performance of the models better.
